## Project Summary

This project is a web application that will provide real-time insights into the availability and busyness of electric vehicle charging stations. The application will analyze data based on charging station locations, potentially user reviews, traffic conditions, and historical usage patterns. By including real-time traffic updates and providing a so-called forecast of an EV station's demand, this platform would help EV drivers plan their charging stops more efficiently while avoiding busy or congested stations.
